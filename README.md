MINI LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ Overview 
The Mini Library Management System is a simple Python-based project designed to 
manage books and members in a small library. It demonstrates CRUD operations 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) and borrowing/returning functionalities using Python 
data structures ‚Äî dictionaries, lists, and tuples.

‚Ä¢ Tuple (tuple): Used to define fixed genres of books since they don‚Äôt change 
often.
